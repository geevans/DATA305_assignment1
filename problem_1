    *   **Public Speaking:** Essential for presenting research findings at internal briefings, academic conferences, or participating in expert panel discussions.
    *   **Spanish:** Enables specialized research into Spanish-language primary and secondary sources, engaging with foreign academics or policymakers, or contributing significantly to regional specific research on Latin American security or diplomacy.
    
 --- Stage 3: Creating a 5-year Plan --- 
After reviewing all three pathways, I recommend **Pathway 1: Focus on "Data-Driven Intelligence/Policy Analyst" Roles** as the most reasonable and advantageous choice.

**Reasoning for Selection:**

1.  **Maximal Skill Synergy:** Pathway 1 most directly and centrally leverages *all three* of your core skills (Coding, Public Speaking, Spanish). Your coding skills are foundational for "data-driven" analysis, public speaking is critical for briefing decision-makers, and Spanish provides a strong regional specialization, adding unique value from day one.
2.  **High Demand & Growth Area:** The national security, intelligence, and foreign policy sectors are rapidly increasing their demand for individuals who can combine traditional analytical skills with modern data science techniques. This pathway positions you at the forefront of this trend.
3.  **Direct Entry Points:** While competitive, there are clear entry-level roles as "Junior Intelligence Analyst," "Data Analyst (Foreign Policy)," or "OSINT Specialist" in government agencies, defense contractors, and think tanks. These roles are explicitly designed for candidates with technical and analytical prowess.
4.  **Strong Career Progression:** This pathway offers excellent opportunities for growth into more senior analytical, strategic, or even leadership roles within the security and foreign diplomacy domains.
5.  **Unique Value Proposition:** The combination of strong quantitative skills (R, Python, SQL) with communication and language abilities (Spanish) makes for a highly distinctive candidate profile, setting you apart from those with only policy backgrounds or only technical backgrounds.
